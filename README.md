# Data Equity for Main Street

Are you interested in learning about open data or teaching about open data to your community? The Data Equity for Main Street project has developed curriculum to promote open data literacy by training librarians and community members how to find, use and give feedback about open data. This is a joint project of the [California State Library](https://www.library.ca.gov) and the [Washington State Office of Privacy](https://www.watech.wa.gov), and was funded by the  [John S. and James L. Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org).

To develop this curriculum, we brought together public and academic librarians in California and Washington State with civic technologists and state government leaders in education and technology. After developing the initial curriculum, we trained librarians across our two states and pilot-tested the curriculum over two years at more than 20 public and academic libraries in the two states. 

The newest version of the curriculum is online and interactive. It is built for both learners and instructors. Learners can use it in a self-paced environment. Instructors can use it in front of a class, and personalize the content using editable worksheets. The original version of the curriculum (mainly in powerpoint) is still available (see below). 

The curriculum comprises four classes covering open data basics, metadata, visualization, feedback and engagement with open data publishers. The curriculum is designed for the general public and assumes no previous experience with open data; it can also be used for other audiences, such as library staff or government agencies. Many libraries that have already used the curriculum have shared their flyers and outreach strategies. These are included below. If you would like to add your materials, just let us know! 

This curriculum is free for anyone to use and modify, as best suits your audience.

[Course 4](https://rise.articulate.com/share/tgq5Nv_mLxy69ezNDWe45dUeoBSLNnV0) Learn more about analyzing data and also how to help shape the future of open data through advocacy and by providing feedback to data providers.

## Video: What is Open Data? 
As part of this project, our team created a short video that describes what open data is and how people use it in their lives. It's included in the curriculum, but you can also watch it here.

### Sample Open Data Used in Course
- [California Wildfires dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Data-Equity/DataEquityForMainStreet/master/Curriculum(IncludesEvaluationMaterials)/Handouts/Datasets/2015CaliforniaWildfires.csv). This is a very small dataset and is used in Course 2 and 3. 
### Evaluation Forms
*Data Equity recommends using an electronic survey form for your evaluations, such as [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/), to organize and track responses. We also strongly recommend incorporating time for evaluation into each class, just before wrapping up.*

# Thank you!
We are incredibly grateful to our partners who helped create and provided feedback over the course of this project! (We're very fortunate that in many cases more than one person from an organization helped with this project. We'll be updating this soon with a list of everyone's names and affiliations.)
