#  Where to Find Free Images

A Data Equity for Main Street librarian suggests trying these resources for images you can use freely for marketing materials:

- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/): Many of them are free and have no attribution requirements.
- [WikiMedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images): You can browse or search by different requirements. Often multiple versions of the same image. Often require attribution though.
- [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=kittehs&license=2%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6%2C9): Licensing filter is very straightforward with links to the license requirements. The good ones usually have attribution requirements though.
- [Google Image Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=kittehs&tbm=isch&source=lnt&tbs=sur:fm&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi22NTsmbrZAhVK3mMKHdoUATYQpwUIIA&biw=1680&bih=984&dpr=1): Not quite as successful, since you've got to dig a bit to assess the original licensing requirements, but can be useful for basic illustrations, icons, or historical stuff. Occasionally you'll find a winning photo in the bunch, but you still have to track down the license.
